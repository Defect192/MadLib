Name1*went to*Place1*, just like everyday and walked up to the counter to order. "I'd like a*Item1*please".
"Sorry," the lady at the register said, dryly. "*Name2*took the last one". *Name2*was gonna get it. *Name1* wasn't in the mood for *Name2*'s games.
Meanwhile down the hallway...
Name3* *PastVerb* in the *Place1*'s hallway, yelling "*DesperateCry*". *Name4*, walked up to *Name3*, "*WisdomPhrase*". *Name4* then proceed to drop a *Item2* on the ground.
It was at that moment that *Name2* came running down the hallway. "The *Creature*, has *Action1*!" *Name1* was hot on *Name2*'s tail.
"*Name2*, you *Action2*, for the last time," *Name1* declared. But before *Name1* could enact revenge, *Name2* picked up *Item2* and chucked it at *Name1*'s face, who promptly fell to floor.
"Wait what about the *Creature*?" Asked *Name4*. "We must run to the *Place2*!!" cried *Name3*. 
And so they ran, dragging *Name1* by the ankles.
At *Place2*...
"Well that wasn't the most ridiculous thing ever" *Name4* said, sarcastically. "More ridiculous than the rest of the script?" *Name3* asked.
"Wait, we had a script?" Interjected *Name2*. "I rest my case" stated *Name3*.
Name1* began to stir, "Uggg, my head hurts". *Name1* eyes narrowed as they found *Name2*. *Name2* smirked "You mad?". "Give me the *Item1*" growled *Name1* through gritted teeth. "Not my fault you slept in." *Name2* snapped back.
"Guys, let's talk about this", interjected *Name4* standing between them. *Name3*'s eyes rolled, "*Name4*, just let them fight it out, nothing's going on anyway".
"NOTHINGS GOING ON EH!!I??", came a booming voice. It was the *Creature*. "You just had to run your mouth" said *Name4* looking to *Name3*.
"NOW I WILL DESTROY YOU ALL!!!!", howled *Creature*. "Because that's not cliche at all", interrupted *Name3*. "*Name3* is disqualified for hogging the script" *Name4* stated.
"I suppose now would be a good time to--" "RUN!!", yelled *Name2*, running toward the next script location, *Place3*.
"No, not again!", cried *Name1* as the *Creature* took its first victim. *Name2* screamed, and kept running, with *Name3* and *Name4* just behind. "Why does *Name2* always get to pick the locations?" *Name3* mumbled to *Name4* as they ran.
"I was just thinking about that," *Name4* responded.
At *Place 3*...
"Where are we now?" Asked *Name3*. "Wait never mind I'll just look at the script". *Name2* stood to the side feeling *Mood1*. *Name1* had supposedly died in the last few paragraphs. If only I hadn't taken *Name1*`s *Item1*, *Name2* thought. *Name1* stumbled into view covered in bruises, clothes ripped.
"You look like you've been through *Place4*," *Name4* called after him. "As a matter of fact I have." *Name1* said, scarred for life. *Name2* spoke up. "Look I'm sorry for all the trouble, here you should have this".
Name2* handed over *Item1* to *Name1*. "Thanks" said *Name1*... "This is great and all, but can we can go home?" *Name3* whined.
They all agreed, and so they took the long way home to avoid the *Creature*. And for the most part they all lived relatively, objectively okay ever after.
THE END
